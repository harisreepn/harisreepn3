    <h1>CULTURAL HERITAGE OF KASARAGOD</h1>
    </br>
  <h2>THEYYAM</h2>
    <h3><P>The ritual art form of Theyyam is very popular in the northern districts of Kerala. This art form combines elements of dance, music and drama and is associated with the worship of ancestors and heroes.

The two popular sacred groves, where Theyyam is performed in Kasaragod district are Perumthitta Tharavad and Kanathoor Nalvar Bhoothasthanam. Perumthitta Tharavad is at Kottamkuzhi. The ten-day long festival here is marked by the performance of theyamms like Ilayur, Chamundi and several others.

      For Theyyam lovers, Kanathoor Nalvar Bhoothasthanam offers a spectacle of 40 odd theyyams. </P></h3>
