  <h1>BEKAL FORT</h1></br>
<img scr="bekalfort1.jpg"/>
<h3>Around 16 km south of Kasaragod in Northern Kerala and on the shores of Arabian sea lies the massive Bekal Fort. It is among the largest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, the fort rises 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjenaya Temple with its famous masonry, and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions of the fort. Much effort has been taken to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach</h3>
<h2>HISTORY OF BEKAL FORT</h2>
<h3><p>During the Perumal Age Bekal was a part of Mahodayapuram. Following the decline of Mahodayapuram Perumals, Bekal came under the sovereignty of the Mushika or Kolathiri or Chirakkal Royal Family in the 12th century.The maritime importance of Bekal increased under the Kolathiris and Malabar became an important port town.</P>

<p>After the Battle of Talikota in 1565 feudatory chieftains including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayaks) became powerful in the region. Bekal served as a hub to first dominate, then later defend Malabar. The economic importance of this port town prompted the Nayakas to fortify Bekal subsequently. Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka initiated the construction of the fort and it was completed in 1650 AD by Shivappa Nayaka. Chandragiri fort near Kasargod was also built during this period.

<p>The struggles between the Kolathiries and Nayaks to hold this area ended when Hyder Ali conquered the Nayakas and Bekal fell into the hands of Mysore kings.

<p>It was an important military station for Tipu Sultan when he led a military expedition to capture Malabar. The coins and artefacts found in archaeological excavations at Bekal fort indicate the strong presence of Mysore Sultans. Tipu Sultan's death during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War ended Mysorean control in 1799. The fort came under the British East India Company's control and became the headquarters of the Bekal Taluk of South Canara District in Bombay presidency. The political and economic importance of Bekal and its port declined.</p>

<p>Nearby the Mukhyaprana Temple of Hanuman and ancient Muslim mosque bear testimony to the religious harmony that prevailed in the area.</p></h3>

<img src="mosque.jpg"/>
<h3>Malik Deenar (Arabic: مالك دينار‎, romanized: Mālik b. Dīnār, Malayalam: മാലിക് ദീനാര്‍) (died 748 CE) was Persian scholar and traveller. He was one of the first known Muslims to have come to India in order to propagate Islam in the Indian Subcontinent after the departure of King Cheraman Perumal. Even though historians do not agree on the exact place of his death, it is widely accepted that he died at Kasaragod and that his relics were buried at the Malik Dinar Mosque in Thalangara, Kasaragod. Belonging to the generation of the tabi'i, Malik is called a reliable traditionalist in Sunni sources, and is said to have transmitted from such authorities as Malik ibn Anas and Ibn Sirin. He was the son of a Persian slave from Kabul who became a disciple of Hasan al-Basri. He died just before the epidemic of plague which caused considerable ravages in Basra in 748-49 CE, with various traditions placing his death either at 744-45 or 747-48 CE. </h3>
