<h2>BEKAL FORT</h2>
<p>
Around 16 km south of Kasaragod in Northern Kerala and on the shores of Arabian sea lies the massive Bekal Fort. It is among the largest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, the fort rises 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjenaya Temple with its famous masonry, and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions of the fort. Much effort has been taken to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach.</p>
